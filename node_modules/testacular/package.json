  "readme": "# Testacular [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/vojtajina/testacular.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/vojtajina/testacular)\n\nA simple tool that allows you to execute JavaScript code in multiple _real_ browsers, powered by [Node.js] and [Socket.io].\n\n[![Build Status](https://github.com/vojtajina/testacular/raw/master/screencast_858.png)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVw8N3hTfCI)\n\n**The main purpose of Testacular is to make your TDD development easy, fast, and fun.**\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- [Node.js]\n- [NPM] (shipped with Node since 0.6.3)\n\n\n## Installation\n\n````bash\nsudo npm install -g testacular\n\n# or install in a local folder (you have to create symlinks to binaries on your own)\nnpm install testacular\n````\n\nYou can install Testacular even without NPM, just get the latest package and create symlinks:\n\n````bash\n# replace x.y.z with latest version\ncurl http://registry.npmjs.org/testacular/-/testacular-x.y.z.tgz | tar -xv && mv package testacular\n\n# create symlinks (optional)\ncd testacular\nsudo ln -s $PWD/bin/testacular /usr/local/bin/testacular\n````\n\n## What is it good for?\n\nMostly for testing code in multiple browsers (desktop, mobile, tablets):\n\n- executing tests locally during development\n- executing tests on a continuous integration server\n\n\n## Let's do it!\n\nGo into your project and create a testacular configuration. Basically you need to specify the source files that you want to execute.\n\nFor an example configuration, see [test/client/config.js](https://github.com/vojtajina/testacular/blob/master/test/client/config.js) which contains most of the options.\n\n````bash\n# create config file (testacular.conf.js by default)\ntestacular init\n\n# start server\ntestacular start\n\n# open browsers you want to test (if testacular is not configured to do it for you)\nopen http://localhost:8080\n\n# if you want to run tests manually (without auto watching file changes), you can:\ntestacular run\n````\n\n## Testing frameworks support\n\nTestacular is not an assertion framework, so for that you can use pretty much anything you like.\n\nHowever, we provide an adapter for [Jasmine].\nIf you wanna write an adapter for your favourite testing framework, that's great - check out [adapter/jasmine.src.js](https://github.com/vojtajina/testacular/blob/master/adapter/jasmine.src.js) and write your own.\n\n\n## Why am I doing this?\n\nThroughout the development of [AngularJS], we've been using [JSTD] for testing. I really think that JSTD is a good idea. Unfortunately, we had many problems with JSTD, so we decided to write our own test runner based on the same idea. We wanted a simple tool just for executing JavaScript tests that is both stable and fast. That's why we use the awesome [Socket.io] library. More than that, with [Node.js], we can execute JavaScript without the overhead of a browser, which is much faster. This speed is very helpful during development when we need to get feedback as quick as possible.\n\n\n## Development\n\nIf you are thinking about making Testacular better, or you just want to hack on it, that's great - go and [fork the repo].\n\n````bash\ngit clone git://github.com/vojtajina/testacular.git # or clone your fork\n\ncd testacular\nsudo npm install . --dev # install all dev dependencies (such as grunt, jasmine-node, etc...)\n````\n\nIf you have any further questions, join the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/testacular) or [submit an issue](https://github.com/vojtajina/testacular/issues/new).\n\nYou can follow [@TestacularJS](http://twitter.com/TestacularJS) as well.\n\n\n## Versions\n\nTestacular uses [Semantic Versioning]. All even versions (eg. `0.2.x`, `0.4.x`) are stable.\n\n### Stable channel\n\n    npm install -g testacular\n\n### Canary channel\n\n    npm install -g testacular@canary\n\n<!--\n- anything on console will leak whole iframe window\n- it clears console before run (but works only in FF), Chrome/Safari does not allow, so do this:\nconsole.clear = clear;\n-->\n\n[AngularJS]: http://angularjs.org/\n[JSTD]: http://code.google.com/p/js-test-driver/\n[Socket.io]: http://socket.io/\n[Node.js]: http://nodejs.org/\n[NPM]: http://npmjs.org/\n[Grunt]: http://gruntjs.com/\n[Jasmine]: http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/\n[fork the repo]: https://github.com/vojtajina/testacular/fork_select\n[Semantic Versioning]: http://semver.org/\n",
