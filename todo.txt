User Stories to finish current MMF:
* multi-user clear button
- send pointer events on touch, not just mouse move?
- make mouse pointer disappear when it leaves drawing area?
- make mouse pointer disappear when user disconnects
- version synchronization across client/server
- offline handling
- collision-handling / conflicts / race conditions
- load management
- server monitoring / error handling
- security (handling bad data, denial of service attacks)
	- nsp, snyk

Engineering Tasks:
* RealTimeConnection - remove duplication in event handling and test harness
	* Genericize draw event methods
	- Genericize our draw event test harness methods
	- Remove pointer event methods
	- Remove pointer event test harness methods
- Look for opportunities to improve the design--how can we make adding new behaviors inexpensive?
	- Location (or Coordinate) object?
	- Server vs. Client event names are confusing. Should be FromServerEvent and ToServerEvent or something equivalent
	- A lot of duplication in server event tests. Tests are pretty ugly, too.
	- Improve client.js

To Do on current task:
* remove getLastSentPointerLocation
- Modify client.js to use sendEvent
- remove sendPointerLocation
- onDrawEvent --> onEvent
- triggerDrawEvent --> triggerEvent
