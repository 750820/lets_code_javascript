  - Note: serious performance degradation in IE 8 as more lines drawn
- Scalability
- Deploy (including smoke test to ensure that div is in home page)
    (needs to depend on 'build'; just running foreman could give us outdated files)

Engineering Tasks:
* Implement each design element
- Test that style sheet is actually being loaded by index.html
- Need to test arrow's background elements--is there a clean way of doing this?
  - Consider using :before pseudoelement rather than a separate div
  - Consider using Martin Grandrath's CSS triangle trick (see comments E225)
- Need to cache-bust stylesheet and bundle.js
- Manually confirm that styling works cross-platform
- What about alt tags? Semantic markup?
- Fix old test breakage that occurs when changing body margins (don't assume body margins? don't always load CSS?)
- How do we deal with errors related to CSS test HTML and production HTML having different structure?
- Need to isolate Safari problem that occurs with getBoundingClientRect and getComputedStyle()
  - See 'create iOS Safari failure' test (ref E229)
- Automatically convert psuedoclasses to regular classes in our tests?

Goal: expect(css("myHeadline").isCentered()).to.be(true)

To Do on current task:
* Factor out class handling for :hover and :active states
- Take out HtmlElement usage?

Notes:
- NodeUnit default reporter has minor display issue on Windows
