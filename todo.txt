To Do on current task:
* AT START OF NEXT EPISODE:
	- integrated
	- deployed
	- updated dependencies
	- upgraded Mobile Safari & iOS from v8 to v9
	- ran into Windows+npm path length problem (Karma's fault)
	- upgraded Node 0.12.4 --> 5.0.0
	- flattened npm modules:
		- `rm -rf node_modules`
		- `npm install --ignore-scripts`
		- commit
		- `npm rebuild`
		- `git status`
		- update .gitignore (mostly just stripping out nesting)
		- remove optional modules
		- `git commit -a --amend`
		- git was smart enough to rename the majority of files!
