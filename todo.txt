    (needs to depend on 'build'; just running foreman could give us outdated files)

Engineering Tasks:
* Implement each design element
- backgroundColorOf() -- how should it deal with hex values? (use assertion style rather than expect style?)
- Test that style sheet is actually being loaded by index.html
- Need to cache-bust stylesheet and bundle.js
- Confirm that styling works cross-platform
- Should isElementCenteredInPage() force element to have a width other than 100%?
- What about alt tags? Semantic markup?
- Fix old test breakage that occurs when changing body margins (don't assume body margins? don't always load CSS?)

Goal: expect(css("myHeadline").isCentered()).to.be(true)

To Do on current task:
- Fix ugliness in "center" assertions ("isTextCenteredOnPage"?)
  - Michal Svoboda's E215 comment re centered elements

Notes:
- NodeUnit default reporter has minor display issue on Windows
