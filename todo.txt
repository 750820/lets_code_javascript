Minimum Marketable Features:
+ marketing home page (episodes 1-32)
* single-user painting on home page (episodes 33+)
- collaborative painting
- support more browsers (Android, IE10?)
- wiki-fy the pages
- more complex painting?

User Stories:
* drawing should continue even if user leaves boundaries (just pick up again when they come back in)
- draw a single pixel when mouse is clicked (or screen is tapped)
- 'clear screen' button
- quality user-facing site design
? click tracking needs to account for margin, border, and padding (if needed; fail fast if not)
  - test that em is converted px
- Site monitoring and logging
- Performance
- Scalability
- Deploy (including smoke test to ensure that div is in home page)
    (needs to depend on 'build'; just running foreman could give us outdated files)

Engineering Tasks:
* Update Karma 0.8.x --> 0.10.x
  - What is up with IE 8 failing when Chrome is not running?
  --> fails when *even number* of browsers running, with off-by-one error. (?!?!?)
