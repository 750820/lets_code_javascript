User Stories:
* draw a single pixel when mouse is clicked
- draw a single pixel when screen is tapped
  - note: client.endDrag() is not currently called when touch stops. There's an error in HtmlElement:
    # of touches in endtouch event is number of touches *left*, so zero, not one.
  - Modernizr touch detection is broken--tests fail on IE8 depending on number of browsers captured due to 9px detection
? fix gaps in lines when zoomed in
- 'clear screen' button
- non-embarrasing site design
? painting tools (such as colors or line width)
? fix issue: drawing area doesn't quite fit to borders
  - correct in Safari, Mobile Safari, IE 8
  - can draw slightly outside border Chrome, Firefox
  - shifted slightly to top-left in IE 9
? click tracking needs to account for margin, border, and padding (if needed; fail fast if not)
  - test that em is converted px
- Site monitoring and logging
- Performance
  - Note: serious performance degradation in IE 8 as more lines drawn
- Scalability
- Deploy (including smoke test to ensure that div is in home page)
    (needs to depend on 'build'; just running foreman could give us outdated files)
- quality user-facing site design

Engineering Tasks:
* modify SvgCanvas to support drawing a single dot (drawLine doesn't work)

To Do on current task:
- SvgCanvas should have a drawDot method
