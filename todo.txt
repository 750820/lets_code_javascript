To Do on current task:
- AT START OF NEXT EPISODE:
  - Mention clean up of browser test code
  - Mention Windows fixes:
    - Jake exclude() bug workaround in nodeTestFiles()
    - New testacular() method with path.normalize()
    - Testacular errors do not output on 'run' terminal -- need to figure that out
      - Defect in Jake?

Future ideas:
- Create 'fail fast' assertion code
- Abstract test framework? (Swap out a different framework to make sure abstraction works)
- Static checking of function parameters (rather than writing tests)
- Handle errors properly in server.js
- server.stop() waits for open connections to close (e.g., Firefox keeps open connection).
  Make it forcibly close?
- Remove Node version duplication between package.json and Jakefile.js
- Fix httpGet duplication
- Automated npm rebuild (Remove node_modules .bin directory from repository (and add to .gitignore) and 'npm rebuild' in jake.sh / jake.bat if .bin directory not found. Also add to CI script?)
- Ensure that every browser has same of number of tests running
- Automatically start Testacular (or provide friendlier error message when it isn't running?)

Notes:
- NodeUnit default reporter has minor display issue on Windows
