Minimum Marketable Features:
+ marketing home page (episodes 1-32)
* single-user painting on home page (episodes 33+)
	? support more browsers (Android, IE10, IE11)
- collaborative painting
- wiki-fy the pages
- more complex painting?
- more collaborative features?

User Stories:
* draw a single pixel when screen is tapped
? fix gaps in lines when zoomed in
- 'clear screen' button
- non-embarrasing site design
? painting tools (such as colors or line width)
? fix issue: drawing area doesn't quite fit to borders
  - correct in Safari, Mobile Safari, IE 8
  - can draw slightly outside border Chrome, Firefox
  - shifted slightly to top-left in IE 9
? click tracking needs to account for margin, border, and padding (if needed; fail fast if not)
  - test that em is converted px
- Site monitoring and logging
- Performance
  - Note: serious performance degradation in IE 8 as more lines drawn
- Scalability
- Deploy (including smoke test to ensure that div is in home page)
    (needs to depend on 'build'; just running foreman could give us outdated files)
- quality user-facing site design

Engineering Tasks:
* Modify HtmlElement.triggerSingleTouchEnd() and .triggerSingleTouchCancel() to generate zero touches.
- Modify HtmlElement to look for *zero* touches when the touch ends. (Or make some other change.)
- Re-enable dot test in _client_test.js
- Clean up HtmlElementTest eventMonitor code and usage
- Clean up HtmlElement and its overly? complex function-creating functions
- Modernizr touch detection is broken--tests fail on IE8 depending on number of browsers captured due to 9px detection

To Do on current task:
- Remove triggerSingleTouchEnd() and triggerSingleTouchCancel()


Notes:
- NodeUnit default reporter has minor display issue on Windows
