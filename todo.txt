* collaborative painting (episode 370+)
- multiple servers
- responsive design
- accessibility
- polish
  - clear button retains focus when drawing (IE8, 9, Chrome)
  - drawing glitches occur when exiting drawing area that is flush against side of browser
  - one-pixel gap on right side of drawing area (Firefox, others unknown)
  - favicon
	- 'clear' button flashes rather than depressing (iOS)
	- 'clear' button depresses diagonally rather than vertically (IE 9, IE 11)
- multiple painting/erasing tools
- save the pages (persistence / databases)
- wiki-fy the pages
- more complex painting?
- more collaborative features?

User Stories to finish current MMF:
* see other users' mouse pointers
- send pointer events on touch, not just mouse move?
- make mouse pointer disappear when it leaves drawing area?
- make mouse pointer disappear when user disconnects
- multi-user clear button
- multi-user line drawing
- version synchronization across client/server
- offline handling
- collision-handling / conflicts / race conditions
- load management
- server monitoring / error handling
- security (handling bad data, denial of service attacks)
	- nsp, snyk

Engineering Tasks:
* Figure out how to de-dupe require paths for common files (such as "_assert.js")
- Open question: how to make sure our test double matches our real code?
	- Use sinon.js? testdouble.js?
- Increase Mocha's timeout to prevent spurious test failures due to CPU overload
- Update smoke tests for real-time networking
	- Replace Selenium? Fix it?
		- http://www.nightmarejs.org/ ?
	- Update readme to reflect reproducibility issues with Selenium

To Do on current task:
- Move fail_fast.js and one client require variable
- Smoke test
- Move other fail_fast requires
- Move _assert.js
- Be sure to smoke test -- make sure Browserify works

- Require options - thanks to https://gist.github.com/branneman/8048520
	- NODE_PATH environment variable or 'app-module-path' module (also, 'aliasify' courtesy of Scott Corgan, E381)
		+ keep code where it's at
		- requires configuration in each entry point
	- Create our own node_modules directory
		+ uses all built-in module resolution
		- unusual use node_modules; counter to what most people expect
		- it can cause problems with some tools
		- requires us to move code, could make it hard to find
		+ strictly limit what's easily accessible
