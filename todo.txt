User Stories to finish current MMF:

- server monitoring / error handling
- security (handling bad data, denial of service attacks)

Engineering Tasks:
* Address duplication of pointer event between client, server, and network code (and tests, and test harness)
- Open question: how to make sure our test double matches our real code?
	- Use sinon.js? testdouble.js?
- Revisit Martin Grandrath's client connection design question (in E399)
- Figure out bundling and distribution for socket.io client
- Figure out how to de-dupe require paths for common files (such as "_assert.js")
	- See Scott Corgan comment, E381: http://www.letscodejavascript.com/v3/comments/live/381#comment-2489897377
- Update smoke tests for real-time networking
	- Replace Selenium? Fix it?
	- Update readme to reflect reproducibility issues with Selenium

To Do on current task:
* Fix Jake so that shared tests run under their own quick build target (run on server and client?)
