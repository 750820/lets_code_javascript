To Do on current task:
- IN NEXT EPISODE:
  - Mention clean up of browser test code, including loose=true option
  - Mention Testacular improvements:
    - Upgrade to 0.4.0
    - Upgraded socket.io in order to resolve Window's npm rebuild issues
    - Modified util.js browserFullNameToShort() to report browser OS so we could check for Safari running on iOS
  - Mention browser upgrades:
    - Firefox 15 -> 16
    - iOS Safari 5.1 -> 6.0
  - Mention Windows fixes:
    - Jake exclude() bug workaround in nodeTestFiles()
    - New testacular() method with path.normalize()
    - 'npm' improvements:
      - removed .bin/ folders from repository and added to .gitignore
      - Updated integration checklist to 'npm rebuild' and check for files needing ignoring
      - Forced Testacular's socket.io to use master branch from git repo (to fix 'npm rebuild' errors)
  - Fix Testacular script for Windows (see 'deleteme' branch -- then delete it)
    - Testacular errors do not output on 'run' terminal
      - Seems to be Testacular defect: opened issue at https://github.com/vojtajina/testacular/issues/91
    - Run Testacular directly
    - Capture output stream
  - Integrate on Windows
    - Start Testacular on WWP-Integration
    - Use 'ipconfig' to determine IP address (eg 192.168.1.130)
    - Connect browsers to WWP-Integration (eg 192.168.1.130:8080)
    - Run jake

Future ideas:
- Create 'fail fast' assertion code
- Abstract test framework? (Swap out a different framework to make sure abstraction works)
- Static checking of function parameters (rather than writing tests)
- Handle errors properly in server.js
- server.stop() waits for open connections to close (e.g., Firefox keeps open connection).
  Make it forcibly close?
- Remove Node version duplication between package.json and Jakefile.js
- Fix httpGet duplication
- Automated npm rebuild ('npm rebuild' in jake.sh / jake.bat if .bin directory not found.)
- Ensure that every browser has same of number of tests running
- Automatically start Testacular (or provide friendlier error message when it isn't running?)
- Automate CI script
- Resolve npm 'extraneous' warning (due to package.json not reflecting what's in node_modules)

Notes:
- NodeUnit default reporter has minor display issue on Windows
- Testacular output cannot be parsed on Windows (issue: https://github.com/vojtajina/testacular/issues/91)
