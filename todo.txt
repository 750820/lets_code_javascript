WeeWikiPaint

Minimum Marketable Features:
+ marketing home page (episodes 1-32)
* single-user painting on home page (episodes 33+)
- collaborative painting
- support more browsers (Android, IE10?)
- wiki-fy the pages
- more complex painting?
- more collaborative features?

User Stories:
* Draw a line in response to iOS touch
- click tracking needs to account for margin, border, and padding
  - figure out how to factor out common setup code
  - test that em is converted px
- Use mouseleave event to draw line to edge when mouse moving quickly? (Thx Danny Jones, E67)
- Deploy (including smoke test to ensure that div is in home page)

Engineering Tasks:
- Get require(), modules, and exports working in Karma without using browserify
  (so error messages have sensible filenames and line nums)
- Figure out how to bundle vendor files
- Cleanup
  - Duplication between weewikipaint.js CONTENT_DIR and our Jakefile
  - Do we want to copy src/server/ files to build directory?
  - What about deployment? (Punt?)
  - Use Modernizr to eliminate duplicate browserSupportsTouchEvents() function (in _client_test.js & _dom_element_test.js)?
- Fix issue with Jake not showing stdout/stderr of shell commands (e.g., `./jake karma`)

To Do on current task:
- Implement require() to load CommonJS modules in Karma (and module & exports)
- Upgrade to latest version of Karma (with new preprocessor support)?
- Take out test bundle code and dependency (in build)

Future ideas:
- Create 'fail fast' assertion code
- Abstract test framework? (Swap out a different framework to make sure abstraction works)
- Static checking of function parameters (rather than writing tests)
- Handle errors properly in server.js
- server.stop() waits for open connections to close (e.g., Firefox keeps open connection).
  Make it forcibly close?
- Remove Node version duplication between package.json and Jakefile.js
- Fix httpGet duplication
- Automated npm rebuild ('npm rebuild' in jake.sh / jake.bat if .bin directory not found.)
- Ensure that every browser has same of number of tests running
- Automatically start Karma (or provide friendlier error message when it isn't running?)
- Automate CI script
- Resolve npm 'extraneous' warning (due to package.json not reflecting what's in node_modules)
- Convert 'client' to be proper object rather than global singleton?

Notes:
- NodeUnit default reporter has minor display issue on Windows
