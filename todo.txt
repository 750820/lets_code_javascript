WeeWikiPaint

Minimum Marketable Features:
+ marketing home page (episodes 1-32)
* single-user painting on home page (episodes 33+)
- collaborative painting
- support more browsers (Android, IE10?)
- wiki-fy the pages
- more complex painting?
- more collaborative features?

User Stories:
* drawing should continue even if user leaves boundaries (just pick up again when they come back in)
- draw a single pixel when mouse is clicked (or screen is tapped)
- 'clear screen' button
- quality user-facing site design
? click tracking needs to account for margin, border, and padding (if needed; fail fast if not)
  - test that em is converted px
- Site monitoring and logging
- Performance
- Scalability
- Deploy (including smoke test to ensure that div is in home page)
    (needs to depend on 'build'; just running foreman could give us outdated files)

Engineering Tasks:
* drawing doesn't work in IE8
  - double-check other browsers

To Do on current task:
- modify test to use feature detection--only run if browser doesn't support events on window object
- fix bad code in setup() method
- add support for setCapture/releaseCapture in our HtmlElement abstraction
  - get rid of drawingAreaDom hack
- fix duplication of mouse positioning handling in our window-related client tests

Notes:
- NodeUnit default reporter has minor display issue on Windows
