Engineering Tasks:
* Implement each design element
- backgroundColorOf() -- how should it deal with hex values? (use assertion style rather than expect style?)
- Test that style sheet is actually being loaded by index.html
- Need to cache-bust stylesheet
- Confirm that styling works cross-platform
- Should isElementCenteredInPage() force element to have a width other than 100%?

Goal: expect(css("myHeadline").isCentered()).to.be(true)

To Do on current task:
* Check logo on actual page
- Figure out how to test <img> tag (or is it necessary?)

Notes:
- NodeUnit default reporter has minor display issue on Windows
