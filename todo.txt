Engineering Tasks:
* Open question: how to make sure our test double matches our real code?
	- Use sinon.js? testdouble.js?
- Increase Mocha's timeout to prevent spurious test failures due to CPU overload
- Update smoke tests for real-time networking
	- Replace Selenium? Fix it?
		- http://www.nightmarejs.org/ ?
	- Update readme to reflect reproducibility issues with Selenium

To Do on current task:
* Get NullRealTimeConnection working in _client_test.js
-
- Improve production code
	- Consider: is a 'nullIo' object better than conditionals?
- Improve test duplication
	- Run behavior tests from both regular and Null RealTimeConnection tests?
- UI tests now depend on network code...?
