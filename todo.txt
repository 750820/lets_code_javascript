WeeWikiPaint

Minimum Marketable Features:
+ marketing home page (episodes 1-32)
* single-user painting on home page (episodes 33+)
	? support more browsers (Android, IE10, IE11)
- collaborative painting
- wiki-fy the pages
- more complex painting?
- more collaborative features?

User Stories:
* draw a single pixel when mouse is clicked
- draw a single pixel when screen is tapped
  - note: client.endDrag() is not currently called when touch stops. There's an error in HtmlElement:
    # of touches in endtouch event is number of touches *left*, so zero, not one.
? fix gaps in lines when zoomed in
- 'clear screen' button
- non-embarrasing site design
? painting tools (such as colors or line width)
? fix issue: drawing area doesn't quite fit to borders
  - correct in Safari, Mobile Safari, IE 8
  - can draw slightly outside border Chrome, Firefox
  - shifted slightly to top-left in IE 9
? click tracking needs to account for margin, border, and padding (if needed; fail fast if not)
  - test that em is converted px
- Site monitoring and logging
- Performance
  - Note: serious performance degradation in IE 8 as more lines drawn
- Scalability
- Deploy (including smoke test to ensure that div is in home page)
    (needs to depend on 'build'; just running foreman could give us outdated files)
- quality user-facing site design

Engineering Tasks:
* modify SvgCanvas to support drawing a single dot (drawLine doesn't work)

To Do on current task:
* factor out "fill" constant (and also style line segments)
- Clean up SvgCanvas.drawLine()
- don't draw dots in middle of line (eliminate zero-length lines in middle of drag)
- don't draw dot at end of drag (click event isn't working the way we want)
- Should we eliminate the relativeOffset duplication in client.js?
- Modernizr touch detection is broken--tests fail on IE8 depending on number of browsers captured due to 9px detection


Notes:
- NodeUnit default reporter has minor display issue on Windows
