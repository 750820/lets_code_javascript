Engineering Tasks:
* Separate CSS and client tests in build
- Split our CSS tests into multiple files
- Run server code out of generated/dist as well (fix hardcoded path in weewikipaint.js)
- install csslint (ref Laurent Bourgault-Roy E339 http://www.letscodejavascript.com/v3/comments/live/339#comment-2240636858)
- Is there a better of handling cross-directory requires (e.g., `require("../shared/_assert.js")` broke)?
- Where do we want our vendor files to live?
- Move hard-coded paths in Jakefile.js to paths.js?

To Do on current task:
* Run CSS subset of tests in build
- Run non-CSS subset of tests in build
- Run CSS tests incrementally
