WeeWikiPaint

Minimum Marketable Features:
+ marketing home page (episodes 1-32)
+ single-user painting on home page (episodes 33-200)
* replace home page with professional design (episodes 201+)
- support more browsers (Android, IE10, IE11)
  - iOS 8.1 upgrade broke Mobile Safari tests
  - Firefox and Chrome fail on Windows 8.1 with a touch screen (ref Mattias Åslund email, 2 Feb 2015)
    - was not able to reproduce using http://modern.ie VM. Presumably due to lack of touch screen?
- replace 404 page with professional design
- responsive design?
? multiple painting/erasing tools
- collaborative painting
- save the pages (persistence / databases)
- wiki-fy the pages
- more complex painting?
- more collaborative features?

User Stories to finish current MMF:
* Fit drawing area to work within standard iPad dimensions (980x661 landscape; 980x1208)
- Remove body padding
- Clear button retains focus when drawing (IE8, 9, Chrome)
- Fix: drawing glitches that occur exiting drawing area that is flush against side of browser
- Manually confirm that styling works cross-platform
- What about alt tags? Semantic markup? Accessibility?
- Validate / lint our HTML?
- Release new design
  - Need to cache-bust stylesheet and bundle.js

Engineering Tasks:
- Move trim() polyfill to a polyfill module
- Fix hard-coded dependency on drawing area position in HtmlElement test
  - "coordinate conversion converts relative coordinates into page coordinates"
- Selenium has broken again, revealing multiple problems.
  - ref Mattias Åslund GitHub issue, https://github.com/jamesshore/lets_code_javascript/issues/7
  - Selenium 2.45.1 doesn't work with Firefox 38
  - The smoke tests don't report the expected browser version when Selenium fails to initialize
  - When the smoke tests' setup fails, the server isn't shut down, leading to confusing error messages on subsequent test runs
- Integrate

To Do on current task:

Potential future stories:
- "Try me" text in drawing area
- Accessibility
- Site monitoring and logging
- Performance
  - Note: serious performance degradation in IE 8 as more lines drawn
- Scalability
- Deploy (including smoke test to ensure that div is in home page)
    (needs to depend on 'build'; just running foreman could give us outdated files)
- Laurent Bourgalt-Roy, E263: fail-fast code (use in devops chapter?)
