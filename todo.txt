WeeWikiPaint

Minimum Marketable Features:
* single-user painting on home page
- collaborative painting
- wiki-fy the pages
- more complex painting?
- more collaborative features?

User Stories:
* Draw a line in response to user mouse
- Draw a line in response to iOS touch
- Draw multiple lines / follow the drag
- Deploy (including smoke test to ensure that div is in home page)

Engineering Tasks:
* Re-do code test-driven

To Do on current task:
- Figure out how to simulate mouse events

- Modify Lint settings for client global variables
- Convert 'client' to be proper object rather than global singleton?

Future ideas:
- Create 'fail fast' assertion code
- Abstract test framework? (Swap out a different framework to make sure abstraction works)
- Static checking of function parameters (rather than writing tests)
- Handle errors properly in server.js
- server.stop() waits for open connections to close (e.g., Firefox keeps open connection).
  Make it forcibly close?
- Remove Node version duplication between package.json and Jakefile.js
- Fix httpGet duplication
- Automated npm rebuild ('npm rebuild' in jake.sh / jake.bat if .bin directory not found.)
- Ensure that every browser has same of number of tests running
- Automatically start Testacular (or provide friendlier error message when it isn't running?)
- Automate CI script
- Resolve npm 'extraneous' warning (due to package.json not reflecting what's in node_modules)

Notes:
- NodeUnit default reporter has minor display issue on Windows
